\title{Predict Method for logistf Fits}
\usage{
\method{predict}{logistf}(
  object,
  newdata,
  type = c("link", "response", "terms"),
  flic = FALSE,
  se.fit = FALSE,
  reference,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted object of class \code{logistf}.}

\item{newdata}{Optionally, a data frame in which to look for variables with which to predict. 
If omitted, the fitted linear predictors are used.}

\item{type}{The type of prediction required. The default is on the scale of the linear predictors. 
The alternative \code{response} gives the predicted probabilities. Type \code{terms} returns a matrix with the fitted
values of each term in the formula on the linear predictor scale.}

\item{flic}{If \code{TRUE}(default = \code{FALSE}), predictions are computed with intercept correction.}

\item{se.fit}{If \code{TRUE}(default = \code{FALSE}) standard errors are computed.}

\item{reference}{A named vector of reference values for each variable for \code{type="terms"}.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A vector or matrix of predictions.
}
\description{
Obtains predictions from a fitted \code{logistf} object.
}
\details{
If \code{newdata} is omitted the predictions are based on the data used for the fit.
